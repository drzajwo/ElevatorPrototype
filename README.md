Unity 3D - **prototype** of elevator as a recruitment task ;)

[FULL PROJECT ON G-DRIVE as a date 15.02.2020 [~460MB]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GvqBy1t7O6ZtWMLFD2jHkZak0TUUGqUC/view?usp=sharing)

After loading scene and hitting Play use "E" button to activate elevator buttons.
There is simple dot crosshair with no distance limit, only react on Elevator buttons inside and out.
Elevator can move between 0-2 floors, this can be adjusted for your needs...

Features:
* Doors are opening on button when called outside
* Doors closes automatically after 4 seconds when no action
* Doors stop closing when user enters between them
* Doors closes when request is called and opens when request is finished
* Evelator won't stop when in middle floors new request will come with other direction
* Elevator will stop for new requests when direction of movement is the same (TBD: Needs to be adjusted for top and bottom floors)
* Evelator contains panel with floor indicators and buttons for opening and closing doors
* Basic sounds added to elevator when its: starts moving, moving, stops moving, opening and closing doors.
* Every floor contains buttons to call elevator

**Scene is not estetic... its intended just to show mechanics**
